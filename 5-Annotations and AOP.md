Following are some additional programming paradigms that help reduce system complexity.

## Annotations (Decorators)
Annotations are programming langauge constructs that allow us to decorate functions, classes, methods, or properties with metadata.

Annotations are evaluated by annotation processor at either;
- Compile time
- Runtime by a framework or a library

Benefits
1. Provide an abstraction to manage complexity
2. Enables cleaner and concise code
3. Helps build more reliable, maintainable and scalable systems

## Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)
1. Increases modularity by separting cross-cutting concerns from the business logic.
2. Weaves the logic for cross-cutting concerns into the business logic at compile or runtime.
3. DRY, SoC, Open-closed principles
