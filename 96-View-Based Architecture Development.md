## What is a View?
Views are projections of the software architecture

### Architecture View
Representation of a system from specific perspective

1. A system can be prepresentated in many views;
- Each with its **own, individual focus**
- In a view, **certain aspects are emphasised**, others are omitted
2. Specialization of the views helps better **handling of complexity**
3. View are **not entirely independent**
  - Certain information may show up in mulitple views
4. Views should be **consistent**
  - Should not contradict each other

3. All interfaces to the outside world
